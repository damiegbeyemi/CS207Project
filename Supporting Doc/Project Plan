A Sound Light Machine called the Brain Machine created by Mitch Altman[3] will be used to achieve the desired technical requirements for the Neurofeedback system.
This device will input data from EEG sensors,
 process the signal according to set parameters derived from a Neurofeedback training protocol
Neurofeedback training protocol: derived from The Learning Curve Neurofeedback system of Peter Van Deusen[4]. 
 output the feedback delivering PBM to the clients via their Retina. 
The clientâ€™s response to this stimulus will then be stored as raw EEG data file. 
Data used to provide a client progress report, and graphing to develop further protocols.
Deliverables
The end product will be glasses which the client can wear, comprising of the following products:
SLM Glasses using integrated 810nm LED lights as the output / feedback mechanism ðŸ—¹
EEG sensors and amplifier integrated into the SLM glasses to read Brain Wave patterns from clients scalp ðŸ—¹
Code using Arduino IDE to program LEDâ€™s to provide real-time feedback via Sensors ðŸ—¹
Github repository containing uploaded hardware design, code, readme and other documentation ðŸ—¹
Final Project Report ðŸ—¹
Project Presentation ðŸ—¹

Requirements
Hardware: 
Output  ðŸ—¹
Integrate 810nm LED  
- Feedback Mechanism

Input  ðŸ—¹
Integrate EEG sensors into Glasses
-Data acquisition

Software: 
Processing  ðŸ—¹
-EEG Signal Filtering using Right-leg driver (DRL-circuit) ðŸ—¹
the signal is first amplified by a high quality instrumentation amplifier, which measures the voltage difference between two locations on the scalp.
signal strength is increased further by normal amplifiers
 passed through a low-pass filter which minimizes distortion caused by aliasing 
occurs when the signal is converted to digital samples.
