-EEG Signal Filtering using Right-leg driver (DRL-circuit) ğŸ—¹
the signal is first amplified by a high quality instrumentation amplifier, which measures the voltage difference between two locations on the scalp.
signal strength is increased further by normal amplifiers
 passed through a low-pass filter which minimizes distortion caused by aliasing 
occurs when the signal is converted to digital samples.

Data Acquisition

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgJegJ30Pj4

Connect Intellifier to the arduino
Solder old Sensors to dry electrodes
Plug in to intellifier using old sensor plug
Cut usb cable end to access wires
Plug in wires to Breadboard
Red (5v Vcc)
White (Data +)
Green  (Data -)
Black  (GND)
Plugin to Arduino Uno for testing
Use pinmode input signal
Use serial to read and write 
Display the input signal
Format data into usable form
Find software to show eeg signal graph
Use processing (software) 

EEG Signal Prioritization

Use Alpha (relaxation frequency) to drive LEDâ€™s. 
Toggle switch to mode of operation:
When person is stressed (high Beta amplitude > threshold (sustained) 
Flash at 12 hz
When person wants focus (Delta, theta > threshold (sustained)
Flash at 22 hz
