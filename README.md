# CS207Project - Photo-NeuroFeedback Device V1.0
Project for CS 207 - building Interactive Gadgets

The aim of this Project is to develop a proof of concept Neurofeedback system, using a pre-existing hardware solution called the Brain Machine, a Sound Light Machine (SLM designed and built by a well known Hacker and Engineer named Mitch Altman. This device will satisfy the requirements of developing a novel neurofeedback system using Mitch’s SLM, which is claimed that “Wearing the glasses often induces colorful hallucinations while in use, a sense of relaxation afterwards and, are a fun 14 minute brain trip.” 

Since Mitch’s design uses regular LED lights shone through glasses, on the closed eye’s of the client, it seemed logical to experiment with the technology of PhotoBioModulation, using 810nm LED’s which are readily available (Costs $2.89 per LED), scientifically studied and medically tested, light frequency device  used to provide eye, brain and body stimulation. Along with a customized software program which will operate the LED’s in a method the Author calls Photo-NeuroFeedback.

# Requirements and materials

## Architecture and Environment

A Sound Light Machine called the Brain Machine created by Mitch Altman will be used to achieve the desired technical requirements for the Neurofeedback system and will be programmed to using a simple Neurofeedback training protocol. This proof of concept Photo-Neurofeedback device replaces the LED’s in Mitch’s design, with a couple of 810nm LED’s. 
The LED’s will operate according to the requirements of a Neurofeedback device; which is a device that reads EEG and provides sensory data to the client in order to help the client attain a certain state of mind. 

This device will input data from EEG sensors, process the signal according to set parameters derived from a Neurofeedback training protocol and output the feedback delivering PMB to the clients via their Retina. The client’s response to this stimulus will then be stored as raw EEG data file. Eventually this data can be used to provide a client progress report, and graphing to develop further protocols. 

Code will be written on the Arduino IDE using the C/C++ programing language to run the LED’s. 

## Software

 The software will be a sketch designed on the Arduino IDE using the C/C++ programming languages

## Hardware

The arduino UNO board will be used test the system by collecting Brain Wave Data as well as providing Neurofeedback using the flashing lights.
